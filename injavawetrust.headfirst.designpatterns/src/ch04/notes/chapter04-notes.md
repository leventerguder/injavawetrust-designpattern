# The Factory Pattern

When you see "new" , think "concrete".

Technically there's nothing wrong with the new operator.
After all , it's a fundamental part of most modern object oriented languages.

By coding to an interface , you know you can insulate yourself form many of the changes that might happen
to a system down the road.
Why? If your code is written to an interface, then it will work with any new classes 
implementing that interface through polymorphism.

## We've got for this new object : we call it a Factory

Factories handle the details of object creation.

## The Simple Factory defined

The Simple Factory isn't actually  a Design Pattern : it's more of programming idiom.
But it is commonly used!

Some developers do mistake this idiom for the Factory Pattern, but the next time that happens you can subtly 
show you know your stuff; just donâ€™t strut as you educate them on the distinction.

## Declaring a factory method

A factory method handles object creation and encapsulates it in a subclass.
This decouples the client code in the superclass from the object creation code in the subclass.

abstract Product factoryMethod(String type)

- A factory method is abstract so the subclasses are counted on to handle object creation.
- A factory method returns a Product that is typically used within methods defined in the superclass.
- A factory method isolates the client from knowing what kind of concrete Product is actually created.

All factory patterns encapsulate object creation. The Factory Method pattern encapsulates object creation by letting by
subclasses decide what objects to create.

## Factory Method Pattern defined

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object , but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation+ to subclasses.

As with every factory , the Factory Method Pattern gives us a way to encapsulate the instantiations of concrete types.

## The Dependency Inversion Principle

It should be pretty clear that reducing dependencies to concrete classes in our code in a "good thing".
In fact, we've got an OO design principle that formalizes this notion ; it even has a big, formal name : Dependency Inversion Principle

Design Principle : Depend upon abstraction. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

At first , this principle sounds a lot like "Program to an interface , not an implementation"
It is similar; however, the Dependency Inversion Principle makes an even stronger statement about abstraction.
It suggests that our high-level components should not depend on our low-level components ; rather , they should both 
depend on abstractions.

#A few guidelines to help you follow the Principle

The following guidelines can help you avoid OO design that violate the dependency inversion principle :

- No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class.
- No class should derive from a concrete class.
- No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes.


## What have we done ?

An AbstractFactory provides an interface for a family of products.
From the abstract factory , we derive one or more concrete factories that producut same products
but with different implementations.

An Abstract Factory gives us an interface for creating a family of products.
By writing code that uses this interface, we decouple our code from the actual factory that creates the products

## Abstract Factory Pattern defined

We are adding yet another factory pattern to our pattern family, one that lets use create families of products.

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying 
their concrete classes.

## Tool for your Design Toolbox

OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled degins between objects that interact
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.

OO Patterns
- Abstract Factory 
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
  
- Factory Method
Defines an interface for creating an object , but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.
  

## Bullet Points
- All factories encapsulate object creation.
- Simple Factory , while not a bona fide design pattern , is a simple way to decouple your clients from concrete classes.
- Factory Method relies on inheritance : object creation is delegated to subclasses, which implement the factory method to create objects.
- Abstract Factory relies on object composition: object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.
- All factory patterns promote loose coupling by reducing the dependency of your application on concrete classes.
- The intent of Factory Method is to allow a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses.
- The intent of Abstract Factory is to create families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes.
- The Dependency Inversion Principle guides us to avoid dependencies on concrete types and to strive for abstractions.
- Factories are a powerful technique for coding to abstractions , not conccrete classes.
