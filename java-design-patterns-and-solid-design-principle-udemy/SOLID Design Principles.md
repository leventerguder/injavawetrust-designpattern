# SOLID Design Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle

There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

- focused, single functionality.

## Open - Closed Principle

Software entities (Classes, Modules, Methods ,etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- Open for Extension : Extend existing behavior.
- Closed for Modification : Existing code remains unchanged.
