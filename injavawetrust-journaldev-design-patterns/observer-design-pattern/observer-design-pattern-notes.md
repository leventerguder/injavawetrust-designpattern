# Observer Design Pattern

https://www.journaldev.com/1739/observer-design-pattern-in-java

Observer Pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Observer design pattern is useful when you are interested in
the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change. In observer pattern, the object that watch
on the state of another object are called Observer and the object that is being watched is called Subject.

According to GoF, observer design pattern intent is;

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified
and updated automatically.

Subject contains a list of observers to notify of any change in itâ€™s state, so it should provide methods using which
observers can register and unregister themselves. Subject also contain a method to notify all the observers of any
change and either it can send the update while notifying the observer or it can provide another method to get the
update.

Observer should have a method to set the object to watch and another method that will be used by Subject to notify them
of any updates.

Java provides inbuilt platform for implementing Observer pattern through java.util.Observable class and
java.util.Observer interface.

Java Message Service (JMS) uses Observer design pattern along with Mediator pattern to allow applications to subscribe
and publish data to other applications.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks also use Observer pattern where Model is the Subject and Views are observers that
can register to get notified of any change to the model.
