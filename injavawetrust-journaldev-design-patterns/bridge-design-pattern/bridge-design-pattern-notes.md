# Bridge Design Pattern

When we have interface hierarchies in both interfaces as well as implementations, then bridge design pattern is used to
decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client programs.

Just like Adapter pattern, bridge design pattern is one of the Structural design pattern.
According to GoF bridge design pattern is:
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer Composition over inheritance.
