# Decorator Design Pattern

Decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime. At the same time other instances
of the same class will not be affected by this, so individual object gets the modified behavior.
Decorator design pattern is one of the structural design pattern as Adapter Pattern, Bridge Pattern, Composite Pattern,
and uses abstract or interface with composition to implement.

We use inheritance or composition to extend the behavior of an object but this is done at compile time and its
applicable to all the instances of the class. We can't add any new functionality of remove any existing behavior at
runtime - this is when Decorator pattern comes into picture.

## Decorator Design Pattern - Important Points

- Decorator design pattern is helpful in providing runtime modification abilities and hence more flexible. Its easy to
  maintain and extend when the number of choices are more.
- The disadvantage of decorator design pattern is that it uses a lot of similar kind of objects (decorators).
- Decorator pattern is used a lot in Java IO classes, such as FileReader, BufferedReader etc.
