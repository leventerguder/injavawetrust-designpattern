# Strategy Design Pattern

https://www.journaldev.com/1754/strategy-design-pattern-in-java-example-tutorial

Strategy design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple
algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.

Strategy Pattern is also known as Policy Pattern. We define multiple algorithms and let client application pass the
algorithm to be used as a parameter.

One of the best example of strategy pattern is Collections.sort() method that takes Comparator parameter. Based on the
different implementations of Comparator interfaces, the Objects are getting sorted in different ways.

## Strategy Design Pattern Important Points

- We could have used composition to create instance variable for strategies but we should avoid that as we want the
  specific strategy to be applied for a particular task. Same is followed in Collections.sort() and Arrays.sort() method
  that take comparator as argument.
- Strategy Pattern is very similar to State Pattern. One of the difference is that Context contains state as instance
  variable and there can be multiple tasks whose implementation can be dependent on the state whereas in strategy
  pattern strategy is passed as argument to the method and context object doesnâ€™t have any variable to store it.
- Strategy pattern is useful when we have multiple algorithms for specific task and we want our application to be
  flexible to chose any of the algorithm at runtime for specific task.
