# Prototype Design Pattern

Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources
and you have a similar object already existing.

Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our
needs. Prototype design pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.

## Prototype Design Pattern Example

Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database. Now we need to modify this data in our program multiple times,
so it's not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load the data again from database.

The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then do the data manipulation.

Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature. It should
not be done by any other class. However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties depends on the
requirements and its a design decision.
